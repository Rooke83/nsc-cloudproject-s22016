What did you do since the last status report?

My group met in classs and talked about the various pieces of the project we have been working on.
I done some research into how it would all fit together. I have also started to implement OAuth
on my own VM.

What would you like to accomplish by next status report?

I would like to keep incorporating my groups work into my own prototype.

Any issues?

Not enough time.
