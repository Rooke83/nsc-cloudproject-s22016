What did you do since the last status report?

I created a tiny website on the flask server that uses a python script to render html templates.
I also wrote a small guide to creating a flask server for my group.

What would you like to accomplish by next status report?

I would like to incorporate some of my groups python code and and create small prototype of the
web app.

Any issues?

Not enough time.
