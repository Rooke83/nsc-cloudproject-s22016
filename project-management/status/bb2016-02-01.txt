What did you do since the last status report?

I created a small flask server on Azure that serves a non-static webpage from a python script.

What would you like to accomplish by next status report?

I would like to make a few scripts that use Python's Azure libraries.

Any issues?

Flask servers are a little complicated, but I am gaining a better understanding of how to arrange
a project.
