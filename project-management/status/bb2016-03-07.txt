What did you do since the last status report?

I redid my BASH script. Now instead of generating all of the project files
from the script, I bundle it with a zip file that contains my groups code.

What would you like to accomplish by next status report?

I would like to meet with my group to show them my progress and ensure that
I have the most up to date version of the project code.

Any issues?

Servers created from the script are still encountering 500 internal server
errors.
