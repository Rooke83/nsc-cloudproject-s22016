Status Report
2016.02.24

What did you do since the last status report?

Met with my group and helped combine some of our code to get aspects of our API 
working. I also did a little research into Bash scripting.

What would you like to accomplish by next status report?

I would like to write a Bash script that creates the Flask environment needed
for our API to work. Or, create an image of our server that other groupes can
use on their Azure accounts to playwith/test our API. Of course this will
more likely be this weekend.

Any issues?

No major issues.
