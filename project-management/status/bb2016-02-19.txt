What did you do since the last status report?

I have read through some of the pages Toddy shared with ian about encryption and
hiding info over GET protocal.

What would you like to accomplish by next status report?

I would like update my server with the code RJ has worked on and start implementing
some of the things I have researched.

Any issues?

No major issues.
