Status Report

What did you do since the last status report?

I wrote a BASH script that automatically deploys the rest of my groups code on a server.
But it still has some bugs I am working through. I also helped Chunda make Flask server
on a VM he created.

What would you like to accomplish by next status report?

I would like to finish debugging my BASH script.

Any issues?

I am getting a 500 internal server error. It says it can't find a particualar module that
RJ created even though I can see it right there in the project directory. I just need to 
dump some more time into it.
