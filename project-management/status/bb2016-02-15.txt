Status Report

What did you do since the last status report?

Worked with my group to bring some of our pieces together. I also worked on
creating JSON strings with Flask.

What would you like to accomplish by next status report?

I think now we can start intergrating stuff with other teams. There are also
security features that Toddy recommended that I would like to research.

Any issues?

Flask servers can be difficult.  I have been dealing with a lot of 500 server
errors.
