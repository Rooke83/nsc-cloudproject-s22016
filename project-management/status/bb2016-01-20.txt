What did you do since the last status report?

I met with the team and we decided on a schema for our metadata, and assigned tasks for goup members.

What would you like to accomplish by next status report?

I will invistigate the azure storage python API to figure out how uploading files works.

Any issues?

Not enough time in the day!
