Baldwin Browne Status Report

I wrote how I thought the JSON retrieved from DocumentDB might look:

{"id" : "01", "user" : "test_user", "tags" : [{"tag" : "animal"}, {"tag" : "dog"}, {"tag" : "pet"} ], "url" : "www.fakeURL.com" }

Ian suggested using ports to limit a user's access to only things they have submitted. I will spend some time
experimemting with that.

No issues yet.
