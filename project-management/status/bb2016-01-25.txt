What did you do since the last status report?

I created a tornado server on an Azure ubuntu VM and am trying to figure out its ins and outs

What would you like to accomplish by next status report?

I still hope to create a small prototype for the blob storage using python.

Any issues?

Creating a tornado VM was a little trickier than I thought it was going to be.
