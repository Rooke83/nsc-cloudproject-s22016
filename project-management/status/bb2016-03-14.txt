What did you do since the last status report?

I am still bundling a tar ball of my groups code with my Bash script.

What would you like to accomplish by next status report?

More debugging. Maybe share some of the issues I am having with my team.

Any issues?

I am getting internal server errors that trace back way into the python libraries.
