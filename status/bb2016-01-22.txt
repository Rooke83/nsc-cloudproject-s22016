What did you do since the last status report?

I have not done much since the last status update excpet for going over the documentation related to python and Azure blob storage.

What would you like to accomplish by next status report?

Tonight/this weekend I hope to create a prototype for the blob storage using python.

Any issues?

Not enough time in the day!
